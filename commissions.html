        <h3>Commission a Portrait</h3>

        <h4>Portraiture:</h4>

        <p>The rise of commissioned oil portraits began around the 15th century when the rich and powerful could afford to be memorialized on canvas or panel. Soon after, middle classed patrons joined this tradition.<p>

        <p>When we look at these historical portraits, there is a sense of mystery to them.</p>
        <p>The paint applied subtly and boldly is a dance performed by the artist that captures likeness and defines character as the form coalesces and emerges through the marriage of light and shadow.</p>
        <p>A unique moment captured in time, rendered with paint and brush now made everlasting. Its impact spans centuries, conveying and communicating the spirit of these people and giving us a recorded glimpse into the human experience that, regardless of time, is shared by us all.<p>

        <p>These paintings and the methods used to create them stand the test of time.</p>

        <p>My goal is to produce paintings that honour and memorialize people using contemporary methods combined with the same artistry and materials as the Old Masters used, centuries before.</p>


        <h4>Commissioning a Portrait:</h4>

        <p>Commissioning a portrait starts off with a free, no-obligation phone consultation.</p> <p>Should you decide to go ahead, here are the next steps:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Traditionally, artists would work from someone sitting live in the same room, however, most contemporary portraits are made from photographs.</li>
          <li>After the free consultation, a location will be chosen where I will take photos of you and/or your loved one(s). This session will typically be 1-2 hours.</li>
          <li>Usually, only one photo session is needed but another will be scheduled if necessary.</li>
          <li>This is the foundation for the painting so it is very important that the strongest image is achieved at this stage.</li>
          <li>My preference is to work from my own photos rather than another photographers or artists but exceptions can be made particularly when it is a posthumous portrait.</li>
          <li>It is important to stay away from using flash photography as this flattens the form making it near impossible to produce a quality portrait.</li>
          <li>Charcoal portraits are available at a lower cost, done with a live sitting or by photo.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Dimensions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Approximately $2000 for head and shoulder portrait with simple background, usually 16 x 20 inches.</li>
          <li>Larger paintings are reflected in price. A typical 3/4 length (28 x 40 inch) portrait with simple background will be $5000.</li>
          <li>Adding simple elements to a picture can be done for free but at a cost for more complex ones. E.g. complex patterns.</li>
          <li>Adding additional people will cost from $500-1000 and up depending on size.</li>
          <li>I also do 6 x 9 inch "close up" portrait for approximately $650 (see Mary-Jane on Gallery page).</li>
          <li>Sitting sessions are possible and are reflected in the final price. This takes a considerable time commitment from you.</li>
          <li>Please remember, I am very happy to work with you, in all regards, ensuring you are satisfied with the final portrait.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Payment:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>After a collaboration in choosing the final image for the portrait, a deposit of 50% will be made and contract signed.</li>
          <li>Balance is due upon completion and delivery of the portrait.</li>
          <li>You will need to cover cost for delivery, travel expenses or photoshoots outside the GTA.</li>
          <li>The above is simply a guide and payment schedules are negotiable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Timing:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Timing will be discussed during the free consultation and after the final image is selected.</li>
          <li>Portrait can take anywhere from a few weeks to 3 months or longer. It all depends on the dimensions chosen and the complexity of the piece.</li>
          <li>Adding a light coat of varnish requires a certain amount of dry time before application</li>
        <ul>
